8. What is the difference between external table and internal table in Hive?

Answer:
External table stores files on the HDFS server but tables are not linked to the source file completely.
If we delete an external table the file still remains on the HDFS server.
By default internal tables are stored in the directory "/user/hive/warehouse"
Deleting the managed or internal table deletes the metadata and data from master-node and HDFS respectively.
